title: The 21 Startup Books that influenced me most

This year I set a goal to read 52 books.

I spend a significant amount of time researching books before I read them. Here’s a list of the top 21 books that have had the biggest influence on how I think about startups.

A few years ago I noticed that I was reading much less. I usually spend 12 hours staring at a computer most days, so I found that I often don't want to spend more time staring at a book. Instead I listen to audiobooks. Initially I found it extremely difficult to listen to an audiobooks. I find myself thinking about something completely different and realize I had stopped listening for a few minutes. I've found that listening to an audiobook is similar to meditation - the more I did it the easier it became. 

Once I became comfortable I could increase the narration speed. Initially I cranked it up to 1.25x speed and felt a little rush. Over time that felt slow and I started increasing books to 1.5x. It's now been 3 years since I started listening to audiobooks. For a while I went up to 2.5x but I felt like my retention was suffering, so now I listen to most books on somewhere between 1.8x - 2.2x speed. It's very comfortable and I feel like my retention matches what it would be if I read the book normally. This is the killer feature of audiobooks!
