Reading books is my favourite way to level up. A good book is the closest thing we have to uploading information straight into our brain. It makes sense why - authors compress years of research and thinking into a book which takes you only a few hours to read.

I try to read as much as possible - averaging at least one book each week. It's had a strange effect on how I think: When I encounter problems I find myself flipping through a mental library of books. I can't always remember the exact solutions but I at least know where to go look for answers.

A lot of people at [OfferZen](https://www.offerzen.com/) have started reading startup books and I often find myself giving them recommendations. So recently I decided to review all the startup books I've ever read and compile a list of my favourite ones. I ended up with this list of 21 books!

### [High Output Management - Andrew Grove](https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884)

<% end %>

This is the first book you should read as a team lead and one you’ll find yourself coming back to often. Andy Grove is considered one of the greatest manager ever in Silicon Valley and this book gives a solid overview of what it means to be a good manager.

Introduces concepts like 1:1's, which is the foundation for management at OfferZen.

### [The Goal - Eliyahu Goldratt](https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271951)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271951", :class => 'img-link' do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/the-goal.jpg" %>
<% end %>

This book is a little weird: it's written in novel format and is focused on a manufacturing plant. Don't let that throw you off thought. In The Goal, we're introduced to the [theory of constraints (TOC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints), which is an incredibly useful model for thinking about systems.

One of the concepts from TOC I refer to most often is **bottlenecks**. TOC says that a system usually has only a few constraints. These bottlenecks prevent the system from producing more - in effect they determine the throughput of the entire system. This simple concept has serious implications:

* An hour lost at a bottleneck is an hour lost for the entire system
* An hour saved at a non-bottleneck is a mirage

I find keeping these concepts in mind is super useful when prioriting features on our roadmap. After you've read the goal it's also worth checking out [The Phoenix Project](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592) . It's also a narrative-based book - this time focusing on applying the theory of constraints to software development. _Note: Don't skip straight to The Phoenix Project as it assumes you already have a solid grasp of TOC._

### [Modern Monopolies - Alex Moazed](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Monopolies-Dominate-Century-Economy-ebook/dp/B017RC8CBC)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Monopolies-Dominate-Century-Economy-ebook/dp/B017RC8CBC", :class => 'img-link' do %>

<% end %>

Online marketplaces are sexy. Companies like eBay, Uber and Airbnb have shown how fast you can scale a marketplace. It's not surprisingly then that there are dozens of books that promise to share insights about this new business model. Unfortunately, most of them are incredibly shallow and merely end up repeating things like _"Airbnb is the the world's largest accommodation provider but owns no property"_ without actually explaining how marketplaces work.

Modern Monopolies is different. It really gets into the meat of the matter - and explains the counter-inintuitive aspects of online platforms. For instance it clearly breaks down the core functions of a platform: 

* **Audience building:** Build a liquid marketplace by attracting a critical mass of consumers and producers. 
* **Matchmaking:** Connect the right consumers with the right producers in order to facilitate transactions and interactions.
* **Providing core tools and services:** Build tools and services that support the core transaction by lowering transaction costs, removing barriers to entry, and making the platform more valuable over time through data.
* **Creating rules and standards:** Set guidelines that govern which behaviors are allowed and encouraged and which are forbidden or discouraged.

### [Scaling Up - Verne Harnish](https://www.amazon.com/Scaling-Up-Companies-Rockefeller-Habits/dp/0986019526)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Scaling-Up-Companies-Rockefeller-Habits/dp/0986019526", :class => 'img-link' do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/scaling-up.jpg" %>
<% end %>

We’re no longer an early-stage startup and many of the processes/tactics we used until now have to be rethought. We’re using this book as the framework for making the transition.

1. The executive team is healthy and aligned.
2. Everyone is aligned with the #1 thing that needs to be accomplished this quarter to move the company forward.
3. Communication rhythm is established and information moves through organization accurately and quickly. 
4. Every facet of the organization has a person assigned with accountability for ensuring goals are met.
5. Ongoing employee input is collected to identify obstacles and opportunities.
6. Reporting and analysis of customer feedback data is as frequent and accurate as financial data.
7. Core Values and Purpose are “alive” in the organization.
8. Employees can articulate the following key components of the company’s strategy accurately.
9. All employees can answer quantitatively whether they had a good day or week.
10. The company’s plans and performance are visible to everyone. 

### [Good Strategy Bad Strategy - Richard Rumelt](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters-ebook/dp/B004J4WKEC)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters-ebook/dp/B004J4WKEC", :class => 'img-link' do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/good-strategy-bad-strategy.jpg" %>
<% end %>

Before making any strategic decisions you’ll want to read this book and write out a strategy kernel.

Rumelt introduces a structure for defining your strategy called a **kernel** - which I use all the time. A strategy kernel a simple and succinct way to describe your strategy.

The kernel consist of three elements:

1. **Diagnosis** that defines or explains the nature of the challenges. A good diagnosis simplifies the overwhelming complexity of reality by identifying certain aspects of the situation as critical.
2. **Guiding policy** for dealing with the challenge. This is the overall approach chosen to cope with or overcome the obstacles identified in the diagnosis.
3. **Coherent actions** that are designed to carry out the guiding policy. These are steps that are coordinated with one another to work together in accomplishing the guiding policy.


### [From Impossible To Inevitable - Aaron Ross & Jason Lemkin](https://www.amazon.com/Impossible-Inevitable-Hyper-Growth-Companies-Predictable/dp/1536692700)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Impossible-Inevitable-Hyper-Growth-Companies-Predictable/dp/1536692700", :class => 'img-link' do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/from-impossible-to-inevitable.jpg" %>
<% end %>

This book gives you a brilliant overview of B2B sales strategy and execution. 

Jason Lemkin is the founder of [SaaStr](https://www.saastr.com/). If you want a playbook for B2B lead generation it's also worth checking the duo's previous book, [Predictable Revenue](https://www.amazon.com/Predictable-Revenue-Business-Practices-Salesforce-com/dp/B00ENFXJ0G).

### [Who: A Method for Hiring - Geoff Smart](https://www.amazon.com/Who-Geoff-Smart/dp/0345504194)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Who-Geoff-Smart/dp/0345504194", :class => 'img-link' do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/who.jpg" %>
<% end %>

Read this before you hire anyone - it’s the best book on hiring methodology. We’ve based our hiring process off concepts in this book and it helped us change our hiring process from an art to a science (more or less).

**Bonus:** Check out [how OfferZen hires](https://www.offerzen.com/blog/how-offerzen-hires) to see how we applied the concepts from Who.

### [Crucial Conversations - Kerry Patterson](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Conversations-Talking-Stakes-Second/dp/1469266822)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Conversations-Talking-Stakes-Second/dp/1469266822", :class => 'img-link' do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/crucial-conversations.jpg" %>
<% end %>

If you need to have a tough conversation with anyone you’ll want to reference this book. 

Their model has essentially 7 steps:

1. Start with the heart (i.e empathy and positive intent)
2. Stay in dialogue
3. Make it safe
4. Don’t get hooked by emotion (or hook them)
5. Agree a mutual purpose
6. Separate facts from story
7. Agree a clear action plan

### [The Lean Startup - Eric Ries](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898", :class => 'img-link' do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/lean-startup.jpg" %>
<% end %>

Lean Startup is considered standard startup canon and gives a great overview of the meta of the startup processes and finding product-market fit. I reread it every now and then to get into the right iterative mindset.

Eric was actually a student in Steve Blank's class. Most of the ideas in the lean startup are based on the customer development methodology that Steve developed.

### [The Hard Thing About Hard Things - Ben Horowitz](https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205", :class => 'img-link' do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/the-hard-thing-about-hard-things.jpg" %>
<% end %>

While there is some advice in the book around management, the main value I found was inspiration. Getting an inside view of a startups journey helps you to realize that all the crazy stuff we go through is normal.

**Bonus:** Check out the talk Ben did on [culture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVVick2kf8c).

### [Zero to One- Peter Thiel](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296/)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296/", :class => 'img-link' do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/zero-to-one.jpg" %>
<% end %>

Zero to One centers on Thiel’s philosophy of competition and his approach to building a startup. It’s light on specific tactics so don’t expect to walk away with immediate improvements to the way you do things. Rather, the book will help you become a better thinker.

### [Actionable Gamification - Yu-Kai Chou](https://www.amazon.com/Actionable-Gamification-Beyond-Points-Leaderboards/dp/1511744049/)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Actionable-Gamification-Beyond-Points-Leaderboards/dp/1511744049/", :class => 'img-link' do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/actionable-gamification.jpg" %>
<% end %>

If you want an overview of what motivates people to do stuff then check out this book. The book is based on Chou's Octalysis framework - which despite the ridiculous name is actually really good.

1. **Epic meaning and calling** - 
2. **Development and accomplishment** - 
3. **Empowerment of creativity and feedback** - 
4. **Ownership and possession** - 
5. **Social influence and relatedness** - 
6. **Scarcity and impatience** - 
7. **Unpredictability and curiosity** - constantly being engaged because you don't know what is going to happen next
8. **Loss and avoidance** -

This is super useful for external aspects like community and product design, as well as getting your team more engaged.

### [Traction - Gabriel Weinberg & Justin Mares](https://www.amazon.com/Traction-Startup-Achieve-Explosive-Customer/dp/1591848369)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Traction-Startup-Achieve-Explosive-Customer/dp/1591848369", :class => 'img-link' do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/traction.jpg" %>
<% end %>

Traction picks up after that and focuses on acquisition. The book gives a complete overview of growth channels available to startups and a framework for thinking about them. Regardless of where in the business you are you need to have an understand of growth levers - as Paul Graham says, “Startup = growth”.

The book talks about a bullseye framework, which feels quite underdeveloped. For another take on growth frameworks I recommend checking out [Hacking Growth](https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Growth-Fastest-Growing-Companies-Breakout/dp/045149721X) by Sean Ellis, who was the guy that designed the Dropbox referral program.

### [Sprint - Jake Knapp, John Zeratsky & Braden Kowitz](https://www.amazon.com/Sprint-Solve-Problems-Test-Ideas/dp/150112174X)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Sprint-Solve-Problems-Test-Ideas/dp/150112174X", :class => 'img-link' do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/sprint.jpg" %>
<% end %>

Rapidly prototyping ideas seems like a cool idea but it’s pretty hard to pull off. Sprint gives you a great framework for consistently getting it right. If you want to tackle a big problem that involves some building you’ll want to reference this - even if you don’t plan on following the whole process.

Before the Design Sprint, prepare by picking the proper team, environment, materials and tools.

1. **Understand:** Discover the business opportunity, the audience, the competition, the value proposition, and define metrics of success.
2. **Diverge:** Explore, develop and iterate creative ways of solving the problem, regardless of feasibility.
3. **Converge:** Identify ideas that fit the next product cycle and explore them in further detail through storyboarding.
4. **Prototype:** Design and prepare prototype(s) that can be tested with people.
5. **Test:** Conduct 1:1 user testing with (5-6) people from the product's primary target audience. Ask good questions

### [Simplify - Richard Koch & Greg Lockwood](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0151YR4TY/)

<% end %>

Price simplifiers and proposition simplifiers

Price-simplifying
The first we call price-simplifying. This requires cutting the price of a product or service in half, or more. Sometimes, within a few years, prices may be cut by 90 per cent. On the face of it, this might sound unrealistic. Yet we will show you numerous examples of when it has happened. The new – hugely cheaper – product or service is not identical to the old, expensive product, but it fulfils the same basic function. For example, no one would argue that travelling on a budget airline is as pleasant an experience as travelling on a full-service rival, but they still get you from A to B quickly and safely.

Proposition-simplifying
This involves creating a product that is useful, appealing and very easy to use, such as the iPad, the Google search engine or the Uber app. Proposition-simplified products are also usually aesthetically pleasing. 

Proposition-simplifying creates a large market that did not previously exist in the same form, or at all. Unlike price-simplifying, products that proposition-simplify do not involve a radical reduction in price; they may even command a price premium. 

It's also worth checking out [Michael Porter](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/57611.Michael_E_Porter), who has a similar framework for developing strategic positioning.

### [Leadership: The Care and Growth Model - Etsko Schuitema](https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Growth-Model-Etsko-Schuitema-ebook/dp/B00GUTRAIA)

<% end %>

This is the best book you've never heard of.

The book and it's concepts were introduced to me by one of my friends, Francois Hugo. He also wrote the foreward for the book.

### [The Innovator's Dilemma - Clayton M. Christensen](https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Technologies-Management-Innovation/dp/1633691780)

<% end %>

Why it's so hard for large companies to innovate.

For this reason, the next generation product is not being built for the incumbent's customer set and this large customer set is not interested in the new innovation and keeps demanding more innovation with the incumbent product. Unfortunately this incumbent innovation is limited to the overall value of the product as it is at the later end of the S-curve. Meanwhile, the new entrant is deep into the S-curve and providing significant value to the new product. By the time the new product becomes interesting to the incumbent's customers it is too late for the incumbent to react to the new product. At this point it is too late for the incumbent to keep up with the new entrant's rate of improvement, which by then is on the near-vertical portion of its S-curve trajectory.

### [Atlas Shrugged - Ayn Rand](https://www.amazon.com/Atlas-Shrugged-Ayn-Rand/dp/0451191145)

<% end %>

Ayn Rand was Russian-American writer. Atlas Shrugged 

The book is 1000+ pages, so prepare yourself for a long read. 

libertarian concepts

The book left me feeling that human potential is unlimited. Atlas Shrugged is a brilliant exposition of the things that are made possible by the rational, thinking human mind. 

The counter-intuitive thing about that potential though is that 
A lot of things that we take for granted are the product of free markets harnessing the power of free minds. 

We see what happens throughout the book when people are unshackled and allowed to pursue their own goals. Production increases. Lives are saved. Life is meaningful.

The second reason is its exploration of how a society disintegrates when we deny human nature. The great tragedy I see throughout Atlas is the tragedy of what might have been. The producers are destroyed, and their destroyers continue to be oblivious to their destruction. 

**Sidenote:** One of the most important principles in economics is that we rarely if ever take account of the unseen, unintended consequences of policies and actions. If you're interested in a real-world perspective on this phenomenon take a look at [Discrimination and Disparities](https://www.amazon.com/Discrimination-Disparities-Thomas-Sowell/dp/154164560X) by Thomas Sowell.

### [Four Steps to the Epiphany - Steve Blank](https://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steve-Blank/dp/0989200507)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steve-Blank/dp/0989200507", :class => 'img-link' do %>

<% end %>

These first two steps validate the assumptions in your business model, that a market exists for your product, who your customers will be, the target buyers, establishes pricing, sales process and channels strategy.

1. **Customer Discovery** is about finding out if there are customers for your idea and if and what they would be willing to pay for it, before you write a line of code. "Get out of the building"
2. **Customer Validation** creates a repeatable sales and marketing road-map based on the lessons learned in selling (not giving it away) to the first early customers. 
3. **Customer Creation** builds on early sales success and after completion of Customer Validation. Customer Creation strategies define the four types of start-up
4. **Company Building** is where the company transitions from its informal learning and discovery oriented Customer Development team into formal sales, marketing and business development teams.

Steve Blank also has a really [great blog](https://steveblank.com/) where he talks about startups and marketing. If you're planning a trip to San Francisco I highly recommend you check out [Steve's guide to Silicon Valley](https://steveblank.com/visitors-guide/).

### [The Beginning on Infinity - David Deutsch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670022756)

How knowledge is created, what a good governance system is.

### [Essays by Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html)

First off I should say that this isn't actually a book, but rather a collection of essays. Paul Graham is the co-founder of [YCombinator](http://www.ycombinator.com/), a startup accelerator in Silicon Valley which has funded companies like Airbnb, Dropbox, Reddit and Stripe.

Below are a few of his best essays:

* [Do Things That Don't Scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html)
* [Startup = Growth](http://paulgraham.com/growth.html)
* [Write like you talk](http://paulgraham.com/talk.html)
* [What Startups Are Really Like](http://paulgraham.com/really.html)
* [The Hardest Lessons for Startups to Learn](http://paulgraham.com/startuplessons.html)

It's also really worth checking out [YC Startup School](https://www.startupschool.org/?course=1) for more wisdom like this.
