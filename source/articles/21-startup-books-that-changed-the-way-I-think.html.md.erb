Reading books is my favourite way to level up. A good book is the closest thing we have to uploading information straight into our brain. It makes sense why - authors compress years of research and thinking into a book which takes you only a few hours to read.

I try to read as much as possible - averaging at least one book each week. It's had a strange effect on how I think: When I encounter problems I find myself flipping through a mental library of books to find solutions.

A lot of people at [OfferZen](https://www.offerzen.com/) have started reading startup books and I often find myself giving them recommendations. So recently I decided to review all the startup books I've ever read and compile a list of my favourite ones. I ended up with this list of 21 books!

### [High Output Management - Andrew Grove](https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884)

**What is it about?**

<% end %>

**What is it about?** While there is some advice in the book around management, the main value I found was inspiration. Getting an inside view of a startups journey helps you to realize that all the crazy stuff we go through is normal.

<% end %>

**What is it about?** Traction picks up after that and focuses on acquisition. The book gives a complete overview of growth channels available to startups and a framework for thinking about them.

<% end %>

Rapidly prototyping ideas seems like a cool idea but it’s pretty hard to pull off. Sprint gives you a great framework for consistently getting it right. If you want to tackle a big problem that involves some building you’ll want to reference this - even if you don’t plan on following the whole process.
