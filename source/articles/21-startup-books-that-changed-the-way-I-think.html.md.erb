Reading books is my favourite way to level up. A good book is the closest thing we have to uploading information straight into our brain. It makes sense why - authors compress years of research and thinking into a book which takes you only a few hours to read.

I try to read as much as possible - averaging at least one book each week. It's had a strange effect on how I think: When I encounter problems I find myself flipping through a mental library of books. I can't always remember the exact solutions but I at least know where to go look for answers.

A lot of people at [OfferZen](https://www.offerzen.com/) have started reading startup books and I often find myself giving them recommendations. So recently I decided to review all the startup books I've ever read and compile a list of my favourite ones. I ended up with this list of 21 books!

### [High Output Management - Andrew Grove](https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884)

    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/high-output-management.jpg" %>
<% end %>

This is the first book you should read as a team lead and one you’ll find yourself coming back to often. Andy Grove is considered one of the greatest manager ever in Silicon Valley and this book gives a solid overview of what it means to be a good manager.

Introduces concepts like 1:1's, which is the foundation for management at OfferZen.

### [The Goal - Eliyahu Goldratt](https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271951)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271951" do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/the-goal.jpg" %>
<% end %>

A great deal of the way we think about throughput vs. efficiency is based off The Goal. You’ll find this book useful when thinking about what cadence your team should have, what is useful work and how to get more done in less time.

### [Modern Monopolies - Alex Moazed](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Monopolies-Dominate-Century-Economy-ebook/dp/B017RC8CBC)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Monopolies-Dominate-Century-Economy-ebook/dp/B017RC8CBC" do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/modern-monopolies.jpg" %>
<% end %>

This is the best book on how online marketplaces work. There are a lot of non-intuitive aspects of marketplaces that make them very different from traditional linear businesses. 

### [Scaling Up - Verne Harnish](https://www.amazon.com/Scaling-Up-Companies-Rockefeller-Habits/dp/0986019526)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Scaling-Up-Companies-Rockefeller-Habits/dp/0986019526" do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/scaling-up.jpg" %>
<% end %>

We’re no longer an early-stage startup and many of the processes/tactics we used until now have to be rethought. We’re using this book as the framework for making the transition.

### [Good Strategy Bad Strategy - Richard Rumelt](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters-ebook/dp/B004J4WKEC)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters-ebook/dp/B004J4WKEC" do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/good-strategy-bad-strategy.jpg" %>
<% end %>

Before making any strategic decisions you’ll want to read this book and write out a strategy kernel.

### [From Impossible To Inevitable - Aaron Ross & Jason Lemkin](https://www.amazon.com/Impossible-Inevitable-Hyper-Growth-Companies-Predictable/dp/1536692700)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Impossible-Inevitable-Hyper-Growth-Companies-Predictable/dp/1536692700" do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/from-impossible-to-inevitable.jpg" %>
<% end %>

This book gives you a brilliant overview of B2B sales strategy and execution. 

Jason Lemkin is the founder of [SaaStr](https://www.saastr.com/). If you want a playbook for B2B lead generation it's also worth checking the duo's previous book, [Predictable Revenue](https://www.amazon.com/Predictable-Revenue-Business-Practices-Salesforce-com/dp/B00ENFXJ0G).

### [Who: A Method for Hiring - Geoff Smart](https://www.amazon.com/Who-Geoff-Smart/dp/0345504194)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Who-Geoff-Smart/dp/0345504194" do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/who.jpg" %>
<% end %>

Read this before you hire anyone - it’s the best book on hiring methodology. We’ve based our hiring process off concepts in this book and it helped us change our hiring process from an art to a science (more or less).

**Bonus:** Check out [how OfferZen hires](https://www.offerzen.com/blog/how-offerzen-hires) to see how we applied the concepts from Who.

### [Crucial Conversations - Kerry Patterson](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Conversations-Talking-Stakes-Second/dp/1469266822)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Conversations-Talking-Stakes-Second/dp/1469266822" do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/crucial-conversations.jpg" %>
<% end %>

If you need to have a tough conversation with anyone you’ll want to reference this book. 

### [The Lean Startup - Eric Ries](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898" do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/lean-startup.jpg" %>
<% end %>

Lean Startup is considered standard startup canon and gives a great overview of the meta of the startup processes and finding product-market fit. I reread it every now and then to get into the right iterative mindset.

Eric was actually a student in Steve Blank's class. Most of the ideas in the lean startup are based on the customer development methodology that Steve developed.

### [The Hard Thing About Hard Things - Ben Horowitz](https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205" do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/the-hard-thing-about-hard-things.jpg" %>
<% end %>

While there is some advice in the book around management, the main value I found was inspiration. Getting an inside view of a startups journey helps you to realize that all the crazy stuff we go through is normal.

**Bonus:** Check out the talk Ben did on [culture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVVick2kf8c).

### [Zero to One- Peter Thiel](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296/)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296/" do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/zero-to-one.jpg" %>
<% end %>

Zero to One centers on Thiel’s philosophy of competition and his approach to building a startup. It’s light on specific tactics so don’t expect to walk away with immediate improvements to the way you do things. Rather, the book will help you become a better thinker.

### [Actionable Gamification - Yu-Kai Chou](https://www.amazon.com/Actionable-Gamification-Beyond-Points-Leaderboards/dp/1511744049/)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Actionable-Gamification-Beyond-Points-Leaderboards/dp/1511744049/" do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/actionable-gamification.jpg" %>
<% end %>

If you want an overview of what motivates people to do stuff then check out this book. The book is based on Chou's Octalysis framework - which despite the ridiculous name is actually really good.

This is super useful for external aspects like community and product design, as well as getting your team more engaged.

### [Traction - Gabriel Weinberg & Justin Mares](https://www.amazon.com/Traction-Startup-Achieve-Explosive-Customer/dp/1591848369)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Traction-Startup-Achieve-Explosive-Customer/dp/1591848369" do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/traction.jpg" %>
<% end %>

Traction picks up after that and focuses on acquisition. The book gives a complete overview of growth channels available to startups and a framework for thinking about them. Regardless of where in the business you are you need to have an understand of growth levers - as Paul Graham says, “Startup = growth”.

The book talks about a bullseye framework, which feels quite underdeveloped. For another take on growth frameworks I recommend checking out [Hacking Growth](https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Growth-Fastest-Growing-Companies-Breakout/dp/045149721X) by Sean Ellis, who was the guy that designed the Dropbox referral program.

### [Sprint - Jake Knapp, John Zeratsky & Braden Kowitz](https://www.amazon.com/Sprint-Solve-Problems-Test-Ideas/dp/150112174X)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Sprint-Solve-Problems-Test-Ideas/dp/150112174X" do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/sprint.jpg" %>
<% end %>

Rapidly prototyping ideas seems like a cool idea but it’s pretty hard to pull off. Sprint gives you a great framework for consistently getting it right. If you want to tackle a big problem that involves some building you’ll want to reference this - even if you don’t plan on following the whole process.

### [Simplify - Richard Koch & Greg Lockwood](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0151YR4TY/)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0151YR4TY/" do %>

<% end %>

Price simplifiers and proposition simplifiers

It's also worth checking out [Michael Porter](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/57611.Michael_E_Porter), who has a similar framework for developing strategic positioning.

### [Leadership: The Care and Growth Model - Etsko Schuitema](https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Growth-Model-Etsko-Schuitema-ebook/dp/B00GUTRAIA)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Growth-Model-Etsko-Schuitema-ebook/dp/B00GUTRAIA" do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/leadership-care-and-growth.jpg" %>
<% end %>

This is the best book you've never heard of.

The book and it's concepts were introduced to me by one of my friends, Francois Hugo. He also wrote the foreward for the book.

### [The Innovator's Dilemma - Clayton M. Christensen](https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Technologies-Management-Innovation/dp/1633691780)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Technologies-Management-Innovation/dp/1633691780" do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/the-innovators-dilemma.jpg" %>
<% end %>

Why it's so hard for large companies to innovate.


### [The Fountainhead - Ayn Rand](https://www.amazon.com/Fountainhead-Ayn-Rand/dp/0452273331)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Fountainhead-Ayn-Rand/dp/0452273331" do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/the-fountainhead.jpg" %>
<% end %>

This book is massive. It's also worth reading [Atlas Shrugged](https://www.amazon.com/Atlas-Shrugged-Ayn-Rand/dp/0451191145), although I think it's a harder read than The Fountainhead.

### [Four Steps to the Epiphany - Steve Blank](https://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steve-Blank/dp/0989200507)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steve-Blank/dp/0989200507" do %>
    <%= image_tag "21-startup-books-that-changed-the-way-i-think/four-steps-to-the-epiphany.jpg" %>
<% end %>

Steve Blank also has a really [great blog](https://steveblank.com/) where he talks about startups and marketing. If you're planning a trip to San Francisco I highly recommend you check out [Steve's guide to Silicon Valley](https://steveblank.com/visitors-guide/).

### [The Beginning on Infinity - David Deutsch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670022756)

<% link_to "https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670022756" do %>

How knowledge is created, what a good governance system is.

### [Essays by Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html)
